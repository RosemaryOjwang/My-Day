# MY FAVORITE FOOD
>Throughout my entire life, I have liked several kinds of food. I should mention that I am a fun of rice, chicken, githeri and chapati. Of course I can eat any other thing apart from kales and beans; courtesy of a medical condition that I recently developed.

>My favorite food is sweet, easy to cook and readily available. It can be taken with a variety of other foods such as; 
* cabbages 
* chicken stew
